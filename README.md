## Objective
We set out to create a game which makes no preconceptions about its users and therefore has no biases embedded in its usability, allowing for people of diverse cultural, technical, and societal backgrounds to interact with an educational game on a level playing field to reach a communal learning goal. To achieve this we built a game from the ground up using the Unity 2D engine to construct an educational game about ecological sustainability whose every facet we tailored to attempt to be as intuitive as possible to as wide a gammit of users as we could think of such as taking into consideration disabilities such as color blindness and impaired sight in designing the UI. Our ultimate goal was to introduce our users to the concepts of resource usage and associated waste, and environmental responsibility through the demonstration of causality and how when one has control over an environment it is one's own choices which determine its health and ultimate survival.

## Game Design
For more information, the writeup contains far more in depth detail thamn this short description including hypothetical target users, the skillset the game is seeking to sharpen in its users, our efforts to craft culturally-relevant instruction, and the way the game motivates different kinds of players to engage in the learning experience whether they are more interestedd in accumulating rewards or badges (Collectors), those who are attracted by an engaging storyline (Storytellers), or simply those who like to see the world burn (Jokers) among many others.

### Learning Trajectory
To try and teach our users these abstract concepts without alienating our rather young target age group we settled on a spiral learning trajectory. This learning method works as follows: after introducing a central concept, for instance the simple idea that actions have consequences, the game develops the idea by introducing new facets to it while also refreeshing and reviewing the tenet in each new "revolution" of the spiral as the breadth of the learning trajectory expands. Thusly working step-by-step the user is not flooded with nonrepresentational ideas which are hard to grasp but is rather guided through the formational components of the overarching theme of sustainability without making any logical leaps which may turn off the user from continuing to play.
